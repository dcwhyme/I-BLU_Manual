== Part 1: Just a general welcome to I-BLU, what we do, an overview of benefits. The standard marketing wank of most
multinationals HR manuals.

    * Welcome to the Intaki Business Logistics Unit.

    * Overview of our slogan "Supporting the development of Syndicate and Placid", and something on bridging the border.

    * Members maintain their autonomy, but there are things handled at the alliance level that may be up for discussion
    with the proper people, however, have no requirement to change.



== Expectations (Both ours and theirs - be nicer than I am about it)

    * Just a general overview of expectations - be a kind person to alliance and coalition members, keep disagreements
    private and respectful (but emphasis on alliance officers are here to help), etc.

    * We operate in some of the final frontiers of space - low/null - for the most part. It is dangerous. You will
    probably loose shit. Not all ships and fits appropriate for highsec work well out here. Paying attention and making use of the intel
    channel is step one to staying safe.

    * Sharing intel is for the benefit of everybody. You aren't expected to catch every intruder, however, sharing when
    you see a neutural passing through the pocket can prevent losses further in. Also, link lossmails so those who are
    here to fight don't walk into a combat situation blind. Above all else, don't argue in the intel channel, take
    disagreements about what is shared in intel to a communication officer/diplomat/etc

    * Corporation Standings are not necessarily alliance or coalition standings. Yes, your friends may be shot if they
    are in the pocket without standings. If they want to hang out in the pocket, perhaps they should consider joining I-Blu
    or your corp. If it's for an op, we probably need guidance on that from Auriga/I-RED particularly if we keep getting
    friends on BLOPS stuff (maybe some sort of NPSI policy using a unified standing fleet, temp blue isn't a good idea
    for many reasons).

    * Guidance for neutural alts. A lot of people keep their transport alts out of corp/alliance for a solid reason - we
    have structures and are eligible for war declarations. Also, gankers see nullsec groups as loot pinatas waiting to pop.
    Having all OOC stuff under one umbrella would be great though. Just food for thought. Or could do like wormhole groups -
    assign structures to a different alliance/corp, easy to do with ACL's. Sorry, getting off topic, probably not needed
    in the manual.

    * Standing Fleets - we've been horrible at this, myself included. A standing fleet is always a good idea. Always have
    one going and join it if you are expecting to undock. How to set it up, I don't know. A unified standing fleet, as
    I-RED is the military muscle of the coalition sounds nice in principle but may not fly with them (opsec stuff, etc).
    For the time being, having one

    * Moon goo stuff. It's covered in the agreement, but having it spelled out in non-legalese is nice. Once a manual is
    made, maybe we can do a bullet point cheat sheet afterward.


== Q&A information, HR contacts, etc

    *Frequently Asked Questions - there aren't many now, but there probably will be later. Leaving room for that is
    probably a wise move. Ones I would include starting off are:

        * What to do if there is a disagreement between alliance or coalition mates and who to contact (corps are
        expected to handle their own internal drama though a heads-up from a director would be nice if it's possible to
        spill over to a public forum).

    *HR Contacts - Who to contact if you have an issue you need addressed or questions in general


== Addendum

    * A list of structures and their rigs - we have people asking about this all the time. Probably need a bullet point
    cheat sheet on this as well, probably to the website.
