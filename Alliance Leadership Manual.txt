========================================= Manual for Alliance Leadership =========================================


# Probably doesn't need to be pretty, just a quick reference


== Standings Policy

    * Alliance standings should almost always be in line with I-RED Standings. To make this possible, having a living
    document to compare with would be advantageous. Probably a good use for Google Docs because you don't want every
    Tom, Dick and Harry to have access to that.

        * The only exceptions to that rule are:

            * The pocket is burning down and I-RED has went AWOL?

    * Coalition Level Contacts - who the heck does what?
        * Fat Zero, John Revenent ?


== Membership Policy

    * Quality > m0ar bodies

    * Alt Policy



== Standing Fleets

    * We probably need to have one going 24/7 if somebody is in the pocket to start it and put up an advert.
