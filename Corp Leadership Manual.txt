========================================= Manual for Corp Leadership =========================================

#First section is pretty much the same as the member manual

== Part 1: Just a general welcome to I-BLU, what we do, an overview of benefits. The standard marketing wank of most
multinationals HR manuals.

    * Welcome to the Intaki Business Logistics Unit.

    * Overview of our slogan "Supporting the development of Syndicate and Placid", and something on bridging the border.

    * Members maintain their autonomy, but there are things handled at the alliance level that may be up for discussion
    with the proper people, however, have no requirement to change.

== Part 2: Suggestions

    * Check your corp standings. You have probably lived other places and made other friends. For that matter, previous
    "enemies" may now be friends. Make sure any discrepancies between alliance and corp contacts are well thought out.

        * Remember to have members check their standings as well. There are few things worse to not seeing somebody about
        to gank you because they are still blue. Also, if an alliance or coalition mate had previously ganked them, they
        may have set them red, leading to a diplomatic incident.

        * In general, it's best to try to minimize the number of standings you set. If somebody is harassing you in the pocket,
        bring it up with a diplo. Chances are if they are bugging you, they'll bug the rest of us, so best to handle it at
        an alliance/coalition level. Something something top level down, etc.


    * Make sure your members have their overview set up correctly. We live in nullsec where anybody can shoot you at any
    time with no police presence to help you out. Kinda like living in Rural Kentucky actually. Having negative security
    status means essentially nothing and showing that above blues is a good way to cause a diplomatic incident.

        * Guides like http://evedarklord.blogspot.com/2014/05/un-fuck-your-overview.html are handy if a bit dated,
         or a public overview pack (I use PocketsDK, but most work just as well, if not better). Not so much a problem for
         people who have played recently or did a fresh install, but there are people playing from that era who still have
         screwed up overviews.


     * Moving in - keep strategic/high value assets in a NPC station. One of the benefits of NPC null is we have structures
     that we can't be locked out of, nor can they be blown up. Don't keep anything for home defense in an alliance/coalition
     structure. Similarly, you may want to consider using a NPC station to hold high value blueprints as well and use copies
     for production/invention. Just food for thought.

        * Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. We can't guarantee anything other than alliance transport services
        but it's usually possible to find a scout at least. Moving sucks, we've all done it and few of us wish those troubles
        on our worst enemy.

     * Know your alliance contacts - we're here to help you succeed. If you have any questions or concerns, shoot us an EVEMail,
     ping us on Discord, or PM us when we're online. We aren't available 24/7 (still haven't figured out how to not sleep)
     but we'll treat it with all due urgency as we can.

        * Keep us informed with how your corp is doing. It's mutually beneficial to keep abreast of new developments.
        Have a new BPO that you are about to put into production? We can suggest ways to market it. Need to take some
        RL time? Let us know and we can discuss what needs to be done.

        * This is EvE. Drama is a given. We try to keep things as drama free as possible though. If you have something
        going on in your corp that isn't likely to become public, it's none of our business. But, if you want to share,
        talk or get a second opinion, we're here for that too. All we ask is you give us a heads-up should anything
        negative that is likely to become public rears its head.

        * Moving out - It hasn't happened yet but it will. We need a policy on this. I suggest one week is ample for most
        cases (if they leave alliance voluntarily, this is one of the cases where temporary blues may be appropriate).
        If at all possible, they probably need to stay in alliance until their move is complete though.

            * For severe infractions, given this is NPC null, instant red isn't out of the question. Help them get their
            stuff to a NPC station for EVAC (if possible/warranted) and from there they should probably be on their own.
            Pushx and Blck Frog are still things after all.


    * Structure Policy - We may want to toughen up a bit on this. Structure grinding sucks should the corp go inactive
    or left/kicked from alliance. Maybe look at an alliance buyout of corp structures eventually.

        *Suggested ACL to use for structures that they wish to make accessible to the alliance/coalition in the meantime.
        Probably need to make sure at at least one person from every TZ has admin access though for emergency situations
        (such as friendlies needing access to defend a structure, etc).


    * Neutural Alts - All under one umbrella if possible (not always so, I have intel gathering alts that work best when
    never associated with the me ya'll know for example). But, minimizing the number of "That's my alt" calls in intel is
    important.
